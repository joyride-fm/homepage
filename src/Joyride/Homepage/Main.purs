          <p class="">
            We're <b>joyride.fm</b>. We're a small game studio with roots in
            Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ, Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®, and the Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­.

            We're on a mission to build multi-player rhythm games. While we're
            keeping some classics like judgement lines and tile tapping, we're
            introducing new mechanics like multi-dimensional charts,
            gyroscope-based navigation and dynamic music generation to make
            rhythm gaming as social and fun as jamming with friends.
          </p>
